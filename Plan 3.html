    <pre>Routine 3: High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)

        Warm-up (10 minutes):
        
        Light jogging, jumping jacks, or dynamic stretching exercises to warm up the body.
        HIIT Workout (40 minutes):
        
        Perform a series of high-intensity exercises interspersed with short rest periods.
        Examples: Burpees, squat jumps, push-ups, mountain climbers, high knees, plank variations.
        Perform each exercise at maximum effort for a short duration (e.g., 30 seconds) and rest for a brief period (e.g., 10 seconds).
        Repeat the circuit of exercises for the allotted time.
        Cardiovascular Exercise (10 minutes):
        
        Finish with moderate-intensity cardio exercises like jogging, cycling, or jump rope to keep the heart rate elevated.
        Cool-down and Stretching (5 minutes):
        
        Perform gentle stretches for the major muscle groups to cool down and prevent muscle tightness.
